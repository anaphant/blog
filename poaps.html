Or do you have family and friends you want to introduce to the space but do not know how? This article is for you then. I will talk about a project in blockchain dear to my heart that I think is a great way to introduce people to web3.</p><p>TL;DR</p><p>What I love about POAPs is that it is an easy way for people to have a first contact with web3:</p><ul><li>it’s free (and safe)</li><li>you do not need a wallet to begin with, you can start with just an email address</li><li>it connects web3 with real life events</li></ul><h1>Moments</h1><p>Life is made up of moments. Some are more memorable than others, like a first day at high school or a new job. Or accomplishments like when I finally was able to balance my “passe en relevé” in ballet class, which was a couple of weeks ago btw. Revisiting good moments like these helps us find meaning to life <strong>1.</strong></p><p>We love photographs, stamps, postcards and other collectibles for a good reason. They all enable us to revisit and even relive moments we enjoyed. POAP is trying to achieve something like that. Making a sort of digital album of life events and highlights with the advantages of blockchain: It’s public and durable. But above all, what I love most about the project is that it is really easy for non crypto users to participate. I will explain how.</p><h1>POAP</h1><p>Proof of Attendance Protocol, or POAP for short. I’ve heard POAP been pronounced in many ways., but as it is a Latin american lead project I read it as in Spanish: “O” as in October and “A” as in apple”. POAPs are “digital mementos, minted in celebration of life's remarkable moments” as stated in the <a href="http://paop.xyz">paop.xyz</a> homepage. What I tell my friends that are unfamiliar to crypto is “it is a NFT souvenir for events!” And anyone (with an internet connection) can become a POAP collector.</p><h1>How to POAP (even if new to web3)</h1><h2>As a collector</h2><p>It is really as simple as 1,2,3. If you are at an event, phisically or digitally, or meeting someone who offers a POAP you just have to:</p><ol><li>Open the web page app.poap.xyz or the app for Android and iOS</li><li>Scan or type in the code for the POAP of the event</li><li>Connect your wallet or input an address manually (it could be an email address)</li></ol><p>How is it free? The free POAPs are created, aka minted, in Gnosis Chain, which is a blockchain with very little gas fees, that the POAP team pay for.</p><p>How come you can use an email address? Well, when a person claims a POAP with an email address they are not the true owner of the POAP. Yet. Once the person is ready to venture into web3 and holds a wallet, they can claim all the POAPs under the email address at once easily, and then they become the true owner of the POAP.</p><p>Why not claim it when they have access to a wallet instead? As POAPs are tied to events they do expire. With the email what you are really doing is holding the permission to claim the POAP even after the event finished. Very convenient.</p><p>It is safe for non crypto users because it is a trusted collaborator in the Ethereum ecosystem. Even though the project is a centralized one using web 3 tools, the initiative is built this way to make it easy, safe, free for the user and friendly.</p><h2>As an event coordinator</h2><p>There are key advantages to offering POAPs at an event as “it allows event organizers to better engage with their audiences by providing a customized experience”. I have owned POAPs that allow me to enter raffles for example. Haven’t won any, though. It can also be used for gated access to exclusive services. The bragging rights for having assisted a cool event are also cool.</p><p>The application process for submitting a POAP for an event is, you guessed it, really simple. You just have to fill out the <a href="https://app.poap.xyz/admin/events/new">form</a> at the official site with the information of the event. It will be revised by a curator that approves the POAP creation. This ensures that POAPs stays people friendly, and not abused by bots or scams. The time for responses may vary depending on work load and I believe also on language or cultural specific events that have to be reviewed by special curators.</p><h2>As an artist</h2><p>POAP is a very popular project and it is used for everything in crypto! Community calls, digital events, IRL (in real life) events, as a badge for completing courses or tasks or bounties, even as a badge for having met a specific someone, like the “I met Patricio” POAP. There is a great need for designer and artist skills. I would not dare say that there are opportunities everywhere for freelancer jobs as POAP designer, as many communities design their own POAPs. But in Bankless DAO alone there are dozens of POAPs created and distributed weekly. Surely there will be communities and event coordinators that could use your talents as an artist for the POAP creation. Even artist with no experience in web3 can use this as an excuse to immerse themselves a bit in the space.</p><h1>The bookmarks of my (digital) life?</h1><p>Crypto may seem an all digital experience at first. But the technology is actually meant to serve the people and the communities, to be useful in real life. As it evolves it will become more blended with our daily lives and activities, it will enhance progress and collaboration. POAP is one of those projects that also makes sense in our outside of blockchain lives. So let’s go ahead and create new memories, tokenize them, and build the next generation of life albums.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on dic. 13, 2022</p><div class="post__share-tag-container"><div class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button icon" aria-label="Share button"><i class="fas fa-share-alt"></i></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=%23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fpoaps.html&amp;via=allgdv&amp;text=POAPs" class="js-share icon brands fa-twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=%23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fpoaps.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=POAPs %23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fpoaps.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="./authors/anafante/" class="invert" rel="author">anafante</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>anafante</li><li>Powered by Publii</li></ul></footer></div><script src="./assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=7c14a783dfeb3d238ccd3edd840d82ee"></script><script src="./assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="./assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="./assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="./assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="./assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="./assets/js/main.min.js?v=149e72e3ae18744a477b480b19e0c6da"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
