First steps were scary and intimidating. Then I became enthusiast about the apps I was using and teh community I was joining. Now I am excited with possibilities, illuminated by the powerful tool I am learning to use. This following article is a personal reflection on self-sovereignty. It might not seem related to crypto at first, but it is the inspiration.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Epiphany I: Religion</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, I cried. Then I laughed and thanked God, for I was free now. Out of habit I prayed and felt grateful that I didn't believe in him anymore. Finally the only ruler of my existence was just </span><strong>me</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Despair and Freedom.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kneeling down in a sacred place, I felt the splashes of holy water. Blessed drops of H</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">O. Only, I wondered, blessed by whom? A priest. The interpreter of the holy texts. The protector of the faith. The instructor on who I should be and what I should do. A man, of course. Could he ever understand my struggles as a woman?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I was in no temple, no church, but in my own shower lost in thought. Transported to the realm of ideas and existential questions I was wondering how this came to happen. I found myself struggling to define my newly found</span><strong> sovereignty</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When did I finally become free? Why did I stop believing? The reality I lived in is way too unfair and polarized for me to believe in a superior power or some code of conduct written thousands of years ago, interpreted and updated by some privileged few. I guess I became disappointed at how little I was doing to help the world, and religion did not help me reach my goals. Or maybe it was when I became aware of the capacity each one of us has to change the world around us.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Epiphany II: Industry</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I became an atheist engineer obsessed with measuring. Improving. Efficiency. Productivity. Making more with less. An engineer, I thought, can help real people better than any religion. How industrious I was. It didn’t take me long to realize how monstrous the industry was, even worse than religion. It shaped humans into telling themselves a fake narrative, one where owning more and cheaper stuff is the way of life.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So no religion. No passion for my profession. Unfortunately, I told myself, you are on your own. But lucky you, also, you are on your own! Despair and freedom again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The questions I asked myself while meditating about sovereignty include: “Are you really ‘self-sovereign’? Or is it just that you are choosing between options on decisions that were already made for you by your parents, your government, your country, political or economic systems?” (The answers to these I would love to expand in another article)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Realization</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was 1997. In the book titled The Sovereign Individual William Rees-Mogg and James Dale Davidson forecast the development of the twenty-first century focusing on the rise of the internet &amp; cyberspace, digital currency &amp; digital economy, </span><strong>self-ownership</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and decentralization from the State.</span></p><blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe that much can be learned by analogy between the situation at the end of the fifteenth century, when life had become thoroughly saturated by organized religion, and the situation today, when the world has become saturated with politics.”</span></p></blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even before the turn of the century, when I was only a few years old, there were thinkers already questioning how the world was changing and what it meant for people’s sovereignty. Me? Before last week I had no spark of consciousness about the topic. It wasn’t until I was trying to write an essay on why crypto allows you to enjoy sovereignty that I even started to think about it. But somehow it has always been important to me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is all this rambling about religion and industry?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have barely mentioned governments but I have similar feelings towards those institutions. This article is an excuse to liberate my mind and admit that I had no clue what sovereignty was or what it meant for me. As I was trying to come up with some ideas for a text on self-sovereignty I realized no one ever taught me any concept related to it, except maybe, “free will” which you should anyway suppress to fulfill the “Lord’s will” so it is not very free.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Writing this down brings me peace. Before I could even write a text about sovereignty related to crypto I needed to understand why this concept of ownership and freedom is crucial to me. I am not in crypto for the tech, nor for the possible freedom from banks and economies, and not only for the sense of a united global community. It is the fact that blockchains are a tool for a revolution that will bring us more independence that makes me feel liberated. Just as I felt some years ago when I realized I didn’t have to be religious to be a complete individual.</span></p><p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;">From confusion to a conclusion</span></p><p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;">I find it sad that on a big scale, humans are almost disposable, replaceable. If I quit my job, if I migrate to another country, if I leave my society, someone else can take my place.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a funny thing is that on a small scale, in our families and communities, we are not so replaceable. We are unique.  We can drive the progress of those nearest to us. Just as Sir Isaac Asimov's books tell us, we can try and predict the progress of humanity, but we can not know which individual can change the course of history.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That's why big centralized institutions fail: they are so inefficient. They can only care for the big scale and the masses. They are not good at doing user research or taking local actions. On the other hand, as communities have their own needs and desires and resources and aspirations, they are the ones who know best how to help themselves.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The religions I'm familiar with may think that without their special guide or without God in their minds people are not responsible enough to be sovereign. The industries I’m familiar with may want to make us believe the ecological problem is our responsibility and not theirs. The government I grew with has perpetuated itself in power by keeping the masses not responsible and not educating them. But I do not care for them now. For I believe in humanity and I am learning the tools we can use to make a change. I believe in myself, in you, and in our power to change things as a community.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self sovereignty for me is the awareness of my capacity to improve myself and my context around me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now I know.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What will I do with this newly found power? Porbably join a DAO, a community that has the same values as I do and is experimenting towards finding a way to make this world a better place for all.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What will you do?</span></p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on dic. 5, 2022</p><div class="post__share-tag-container"><div class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button icon" aria-label="Share button"><i class="fas fa-share-alt"></i></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=%23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fself-sovereignty.html&amp;via=allgdv&amp;text=Self-sovereignty" class="js-share icon brands fa-twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=%23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fself-sovereignty.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Self-sovereignty %23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fself-sovereignty.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="./authors/anafante/" class="invert" rel="author">anafante</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>anafante</li><li>Powered by Publii</li></ul></footer></div><script src="./assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=7c14a783dfeb3d238ccd3edd840d82ee"></script><script src="./assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="./assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="./assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="./assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="./assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="./assets/js/main.min.js?v=149e72e3ae18744a477b480b19e0c6da"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
