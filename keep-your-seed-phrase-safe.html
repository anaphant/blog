I was afraid of crypto when my then boyfriend (now husband) told me for the first time he was getting interested in this technology. Of course, back then I did not think of it as a “technology”, but of something completely unfamiliar that was famous for scamming people, or making them rich. I was hoping he knew what he was doing, and would get if not the latter result at least not the former. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has been quite a journey for me into the ecosystem so I want to share what helped me survive my initial anxiety and fear: tips on how to keep your assets safe in web3. So, if you feel new to web 3 / blockchains / crypto, whichever you prefer to call it, read on!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many risks out there we should inform ourselves about. After all, blockchains are a technology still evolving as we try out new forms of decentralized finance and governance. Here are just a couple of those risks that gave me nightmares at the beginning of my journey: losing my assets during a transaction, forgetting where my assets are, losing my seed phrase, having my seed phrase stolen, and giving a smart contract unwanted permissions to control my assets.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note: I will refer to assets as digital tokens such as cryptocurrencies (e.g. Ether and Bitcoin) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that you can mint, hold, and trade in blockchains. And there is no financial advice intended in this article.</span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">OMG, where did my crypto go?</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is just a natural fear when you do something for the first time, but how hard it was for me to start using crypto because of this fear! At the beginning when doing any transaction I triple checked the address I would send assets to. Bridging my funds to other chains was by far the worst feeling of them all, I kept thinking: will I really receive them on the other side? Nerve-wracking.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had to learn that transactions are not instantly reflected, they take time and it varies from blockchain to blockchain. So my advice is that when you feel unsure about a transaction it’s always good to make a test. I prefer paying the extra gas fees than losing what I am about to transfer. When trying a new app or bridge I would send just a small amount of money or an unimportant NFT to check how it worked. Once the transaction went through, it helped me get some of the nerves go away. My first experiments were not in mainnet (Ethereum) but in a cheaper chain like Polygon or Gnosis chain (formerly xDai), and guided by someone who had more experience than me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It took me a while but nowadays I buy and trade, and send funds between accounts and chains confidently. I play safe and never put my assets into an app or a project I know nothing about.</span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">I forgot I had money in that account!</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my confusion when first learning about crypto I created different addresses in different wallets for different chains. So I had a mess, with a bit of coins here and there and some experiment NFTs I had created now only God knows where. I did not know the difference between the wallet and my address and my seed phrase. So I thought important to point it out:</span></p><ul><li style="list-style-type: none;"><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Seed phrase, </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">also called recovery phrase or secret recovery phrase, is the key. It gives you access to the assets in all the accounts inside of it. It is </span><strong>NEVER</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> safe to share. You usually generate it from the wallet of your choice and it is important to keep a good backup of it. (We will talk about good back ups in a bit)</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Address</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Each seed phrase can generate multiple addresses. Address is the piece of information you will need in order to send and receive assets, so it is safe to share. You can use the same address in Ethereum and compatible chains, so you do not have to create a seed phrase in every blockchain.</span></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li aria-level="1"><strong>Public and Private keys. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I just said two paragraphs ago that the seed phrase is the key. It is actually the master key for all your keys. Each address has a pair of a public and a private key. Public and private keys look alike, they are long strings of letters and numbers. You usually do not have to interact with these but it is important to know they exist.</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the </span><a href="https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons/wallet-basics"><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Wallet Basics" lesson in Bankless Academy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (which I recommend checking out) I learned that the public key is like the address to your home, and the private key is the access to the house. Public key is ok to share, but Private key is not since it would give access to the assets in that particular address. Just like with the seed phrase you should never share the private key either.</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Wallets</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hold inside them the private keys (generated by the seed phrase) in order to see each account's assets, and to move them around. Wallets are kind of like the platform from which you can interact with the blockchain. It is not the wallet but the private keys that actually do the trick, so you can migrate your seed phrase to a different wallet and still will be able to have control over the same addresses and same assets, just from a different platform.</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So now I know: with the same seed phrase I can handle multiple addresses. I can even have a private address not related to my name or persona, and a public address which I share freely and collect POAPs (event NFT’s) there. The seed phrase can be inserted into different wallets and access the assets in its addresses, so I do not have to stay with my initial wallet forever. </span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t ever lose it</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your seed phrase, the typically 12 to 24 word long passphrase that grants you the access to your assets, is the most important piece of web3 information you own. Put this seed phrase into a wallet and you will be able to interact with the blockchain. But lose it, and no one can help you get it back.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is hard to grasp how difficult it would be to obtain a specific seed phrase. After all, it was a randomly generated combination of words, you can just try random combinations until you create the same one again, right? Yes, only there are way more possible seed phrases in the blockchain than there are stars in the observable universe. That is a lot! So if you lose your seed phrase it is literally worse than losing a star in the universe and trying to go find it again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good things about this, no one can ever hack into your account. Not with the current technology available at least. We would have to worry whenever humans invent quantum computers. And even then, we would only have to make bigger seed phrases, so instead of 24 words we can use 128 out of a bigger list and we could still be safe until the next technological improvement of the millennium.</span></p><h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 3-2-1 rule for a good Backup</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My husband programmer taught me these rules for backups, and it is really as useful for photos and work documents as for a seed phrase. The 3-2-1 rule of a good backup tells us to have three copies of the information we want to keep safe in at least two different mediums, one of them at least on a different location than the one you usually access the information.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what would this look like? First, your seed phrase safely stored in the wallet that you trust, having a digital copy (preferably encrypted) in your computer, lastly a written down copy and stored away in a vault in your bank (do those exist or is it only a movie thing?), or at least in a very safe and private place.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So that is three copies: 1) wallet 2) encrypted text file and 3) a piece of paper privately stored away.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And there are two mediums: two are digital copies, one is a physical copy.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least one of those three copies is in a different location: the vault in the bank.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So if for some reason you lost access to your wallet or your computer because it broke, you can quickly go to the bank, and from a different device get them into a wallet and get access to your funds again. Phew!</span></p><h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still worried you will lose your seed phrase?</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another way to prevent losing access to your assets is using a multisig (multi-signature) wallet. These digital wallets (or smart contract wallets) are like vaults that can hold your assets, but you can assign different sets of private keys permission to get access to those assets. Even better, you can set a minimum quantity of “signers” that have to approve the transactions for them to happen.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, at the beginning I worried I could accidentally lose my seed phrase for good, so I used a multisig called </span><a href="https://safe.global/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (formerly Gnosis Safe). I set two different sets of  personal private keys (each one is backed up by a different seed phrase) and my husband’s private keys permission to access the vault, with the rule that two out of those three private keys have to sign any transaction.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is tedious that every time I want to do a transaction I have to approve everything two times. The process is slower and is a bit more costly due to increased information sent to the blockchain, meaning higher gas fees, than regular transactions. But the good part is that if I lose access to my main seed phrase I can still access the funds inside the Safe with my other private keys and my husband’s help.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if for some reason my seed phrase gets stolen, my assets are still safe. The hacker would still need to convince me or my husband to sign the transactions anyway!</span></p><h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why did you do that?</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are a few examples of bad places for storing private information like seed phrases or private keys.</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Send it through email to yourself. Emails aren’t meant to be used as backups. They are not usually encrypted and are susceptible to hacker attacks. (I got hacked once. No private information was stolen fortunately, but I did lose all my email history for good.)</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Save it in a word or excel document and protect it with a password. They are pretty easy to get hacked even by non-programmers like myself.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Write it down in a handy notebook, or leave that piece of paper at plain sight. Anyone who knows the seed phrase will be able to access the addresses in it and all their funds.</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If someone is smart and evil they can write the seed phrase down to use it years later after you have accumulated a good amount of assets. If you ever share or compromise your seed phrase backups the best thing to do is transfer everything to a different address from a safely secured seed phrase. It is just like with a credit/debit card, If you lose it you call the bank to cancel it just in case. Same in crypto, I would move it just in case.</span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stolen seed phrases</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a seed phrase stolen is relatively easy to prevent. A good rule of thumb is the less wallets that hold your seed phrase the better. Wallets are not infallible and could have your seed phrase compromised for different reasons. It is not common but it has happened in the past. So the less exposed your seed phrase is, the better.</span></p><h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">If no one ever sees my seed phrase it can’t get stolen</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once I decided to invest a bit more in crypto I bought a trusted brand of hardware wallet (Ledger, in my case, but there are other brands, too). Then I  generated a seed phrase from within it, and never inserted it in an online digital medium. So I can be sure that not even a smart hacker or a bug in my computer could extract that information.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How hardware wallets like Ledger work is beyond the scope of this article, but you can rest assured no one can crack into your ledger without your 4 to 8 digit password, and they only have three chances before the device resets itself. So not even losing your Ledger is a worry, as long as you have a good 3-2-1 backup.</span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Granting unwanted permissions to smart contracts</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has never happened to me, but it is something I care and worry about. Giving a smart contract unwanted permissions to control assets might be a complex topic for new users. What is a smart contract? How can you tell which ones you can or can’t trust? After all, wasn’t it all the point of using blockchain that it is trustless technology and so on? Well, many blockchains permit trustless transactions, but trustlessness isn’t guaranteed.</span></p><h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart contracts</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum was the first blockchain to introduce the concept of smart contracts: a way that lets the technology applied in bitcoin transactions do more than just transfer bitcoin from one address to another. A smart contract is a piece of code that lives within the blockchain and can be called to perform all sorts of automatic actions, and it has become a game changer in blockchain technology. This is what makes the technology flexible enough to be used as the world's decentralized computer.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you want to interact with a smart contract you often have to sign two transactions: one is a sort of approval and the other one is for the actual movement of assets. The approval is needed by the smart contract to get access to your tokens and use them on your behalf. Then, once the smart contract has approval to move your funds, the actual transaction you sign for performing whatever the smart contract is going to do, like invest your coins in Aave.</span></p><h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting limits to authorizations</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you approve permission to control funds, you can alway limit the maximum amount the contract can use on your behalf from the wallet interface. This prevents that during a future hack or bug exploit situation the smart contract won’t have permission to move more tokens than the ones you authorized, so it could not drain your account of that particular token.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a disadvantage for habitual users, since every approval costs gas fees, so approving every single time you want to use your funds can be costly, especially in chains like Ethereum. But it is an insurance price I am often willing to pay.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember I mentioned I would never invest in a project I know nothing about? Well, another golden rule I hold dear to my heart is to never invest any money I can’t afford to lose. Some projects fail, some get hacked, some get bugs that are exploited by more savvy programmers and their bots. There is so much going on in the web3 space it’s hard to keep up. Prices go up and down, bridges and companies fail, to name a few. It is truly overwhelming and confusing at first. So what then?</span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overcoming crypto anxiety</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can sleep soundly knowing your seed phrase is safe and you are the only one with access to your funds. As for the other things that could make you feel anxious when beginning your journey into crypto, these are some words of advice I can share so you continue exploring with confidence:  </span></p><p> </p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check out the community channels of those projects you are interested in to make informed money or nft decisions. Many projects use Discord as a means to communicate and engage with their communities, so learning to use the platform is a great way to start.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As they say, don’t put all your eggs in the same basket. It’s always good to diversify assets and even in different chains. It is confusing at first but there are many advantages to explore across the different blockchains.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you really believe in a project you could HODL (hold) their tokens if you sense they are promising and trusted by the community. It is not guaranteed to succeed, but it is a less risky option than investing in new random coins or signing transactions with smart contracts that haven't been put to the test of time. And you can help the projects you are passionate about to grow!</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read some of the crypto news to find out what things are going on and take appropriate action. Twitter or Alphaday are good places to start.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t do it alone, there are a bunch of people out there that have already gone through the path you are starting and can guide you. Make friends you can share your opinions and experiences with and discover a new world of opportunities.</span></li></ul><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it really necessary?</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might be asking yourself: “Do I really have to do all of these?” Well, there are alternatives like custodial wallets like Binance or Bitso, and smart contract wallets like Argent. They usually use different methods of recovery different from seed phrases. In those cases the risks shift and there are other aspects to worry about, but losing a seed phrase is not one of them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other good news is that coming up some time in the future we will have what's called “account abstraction”, which will be a key aspect of bringing web3 to the general public with the safety levels of a seed phrase for recovery but without its hassles.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know much about the tech behind it, but what I have heard is that developers find the issue complex and attractive. Many are </span><strong>hastily</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> trying to figure out how we can simplify the seed phrases for asset protection to make it easier for new users to get the benefits of web3. Once they figure out a way to abstract the accounts we won’t be needing to do all these to keep seed phrases safe anymore, and life will be sweeter. In the meantime, we keep ourselves and our assets in a safe place.</span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why this is important</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“IN A WORLD WHERE BANKS RUN, EXCHANGES GO BANKRUPT, AND MALICIOUS HACKS HAPPEN OFTEN, IT IS PARAMOUNT TO ENSURE THAT YOUR ASSETS ARE SAFE AND IN YOUR POSSESSION.” </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this short</span><a href="https://banklesspublishing.com/the-importance-of-self-custody/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Bankless Publishing summarizes the importance of self custody of your assets and why going through all this trouble is for many of us better than using centralized exchanges that hold your assets for you.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember: your sovereignty over your assets depends greatly on your taking good care of your seed phrase. It takes a great deal of responsibility, but it is not so hard once you know where you have to be careful. We don’t need other parties or centralized exchanges to take care of our assets. We have the power of self sovereignty! Use it bravely. And go Bankless.</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no financial advice intended in this article.</span></i></p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on dic. 30, 2022</p><div class="post__share-tag-container"><div class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button icon" aria-label="Share button"><i class="fas fa-share-alt"></i></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=%23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fkeep-your-seed-phrase-safe.html&amp;via=allgdv&amp;text=Safe%20access%20to%20the%20digitalverse" class="js-share icon brands fa-twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=%23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fkeep-your-seed-phrase-safe.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Safe%20access%20to%20the%20digitalverse %23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fkeep-your-seed-phrase-safe.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="./authors/anafante/" class="invert" rel="author">anafante</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></main><footer id="copyright"><ul><li>anafante</li><li>Powered by Publii</li></ul></footer></div><script src="./assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=7c14a783dfeb3d238ccd3edd840d82ee"></script><script src="./assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="./assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="./assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="./assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="./assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="./assets/js/main.min.js?v=149e72e3ae18744a477b480b19e0c6da"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
